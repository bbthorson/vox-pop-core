/**
 * esbuild production bundle for core-api.
 *
 * Why bundle: core-api's source imports from `@vox-pop/core/*` and `shared/*`
 * via tsconfig path aliases. At runtime, Node's ESM resolver doesn't honor
 * tsconfig paths, and the workspace symlink indirection + ESM-from-CJS
 * named-import interop makes pure-Node resolution of these aliases
 * unreliable. Bundling at build time inlines all workspace source so the
 * runtime sees a single, extension-correct `dist/index.js`.
 *
 * Externals:
 *   - Node built-ins — auto-external with `platform: 'node'`.
 *   - `firebase-admin` — has native transitive deps (protobufjs, grpc-js
 *     variants) that esbuild can't safely flatten. App Hosting runs
 *     `npm install` in the container, so `node_modules/firebase-admin` is
 *     present at runtime; keeping it external avoids bundling ~50MB.
 *   - `pino` — imports platform-specific worker scripts via `require()`
 *     which don't bundle cleanly.
 *   - `rss-parser` — pulls in `xml2js` + a surprisingly large parsing dep
 *     chain (~300KB bundled). Pure JS; no runtime issue keeping it
 *     external. Declared in core-api's package.json so npm resolves it
 *     at runtime from node_modules.
 *
 * Everything else (Hono, @hono/node-server, zod, @vox-pop/core,
 * @vox-pop/shared) bundles. Bundled output is ~500KB-1MB; cold start is
 * fast (single-file load, no module-resolution overhead).
 *
 * Source maps are on so stack traces in Cloud Logging point at the
 * original TS files.
